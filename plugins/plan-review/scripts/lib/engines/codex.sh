# lib/engines/codex.sh — Codex engine implementation of the three-hook
# contract (engine_probe / engine_invoke / engine_extract). Sourced (not
# executed) by plan-review.sh when REVIEW_ENGINE=codex.
#
# Orchestrator pre-sets before calling these hooks: PROMPT_FILE,
# SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS, ARTIFACT, ROUND_INDEX, ENGINE_OUT, ENGINE_TIMEOUT,
# TIMEOUT_CMD, CONV_FILE, LOG_FILE, ENGINE_CMD. ENGINE_TMP_FILES/
# ENGINE_TMP_DIRS arrays are declared (and cleared) by the caller before
# trap registration — this file only appends its own private temp paths.
#
# bash 3.2 compatible: no associative arrays, no ${var^^}, no &>>.

# --- One-time setup (called once, outside the retry loop): CLI existence
#     check + model resolution + sandboxed workdir/merged-prompt/UTF-8
#     sanitation prep. Returns 0 if usable, 1 (with ENGINE_PROBE_REASON set)
#     otherwise. ---

  # codex-only temp resources: a sandboxed workdir (-C target — by default a
  # fresh empty temp dir, deliberately NOT the project cwd: codex runs
  # read-only but there's no reason to hand it the real tree) and a merged
  # prompt file (system instructions + PROMPT_FILE's
  # dynamic content — kept SEPARATE from PROMPT_FILE itself so the REST
  # fallback's --rawfile read of PROMPT_FILE doesn't double-send the system
  # instructions). Registered into the generic cleanup arrays so the caller's
  # trap reaps them without knowing their codex-private names.
  # NOTE: $ENGINE_ERR is NOT declared here — it is a shared orchestrator-owned
  # contract channel (plan-review.sh sets ENGINE_ERR="${ENGINE_OUT}.err" for
  # every engine, and _cleanup hardcodes it alongside PROMPT_FILE/ENGINE_OUT),
  # not a codex-private resource. codex only declares its CONTENT policy
  # below (ENGINE_ERR_POLICY) because codex echoes the FULL prompt to stderr
  # before its real diagnostics — see engine_err_filter() further down,
  # which must never let that raw content reach LOG_FILE wholesale.
  #
  # REVIEW_REPO_ACCESS=1 (opt-in, default off) flips the workdir to the
  # project cwd instead: the reviewer can then ground its findings — and
  # verify the plan author's factual rebuttals — against the actual code,
  # still under `-s read-only`. Trade-offs the user accepts by opting in:
  # repo content becomes reachable by the engine's provider, and rounds get
  # slower as the reviewer reads files. The real cwd must NEVER be added to
  # ENGINE_TMP_DIRS — the cleanup trap rmdir's every entry.

  # a raw byte-count cut, which CAN still slice a multi-byte character in

  # such input — it does not degrade, it aborts:
  #   "Failed to read prompt from stdin: input is not valid UTF-8 (invalid byte
  #    at offset N). Convert it to UTF-8 and retry"
  # …making REVIEW_ENGINE=codex unusable for anyone with a non-ASCII CLAUDE.md.
  # `iconv -c` drops only the orphaned bytes and keeps every valid character.

# --- Privacy-filtered stderr diagnostic hook (ENGINE_ERR_POLICY=filtered).
#     Called by the orchestrator's backfill_engine_err() (lib/common.sh)
#     ONLY on failure — its stdout becomes the "codex-diag ..." log line.
#     Reads $ENGINE_ERR (this round's raw stderr, still un-truncated at this
#     point) and $CODEX_PROMPT_FILE / $PROMPT_LINES (set once in
#     engine_probe(), outside the retry loop).
#
#     Privacy boundary: codex echoes the FULL prompt to stderr before its
#     real diagnostics (global CLAUDE.md + project CLAUDE.md + recent
#     conversation + the plan). Never let ENGINE_ERR reach LOG_FILE
#     wholesale — return only a filtered tail, two-layer defense:
#       Layer A (positional): locate the banner's SECOND "--------" line
#         (within the first 20 lines) followed by a line that is exactly
#         "user" — that marks where the echoed prompt begins; cut it out
#         using PROMPT_LINES to find where it ends, keeping the banner +
#         the real tail after it. Any of the three guards failing falls
#         through to the fail-closed `tail -n 20` branch, which still
#         preserves diagnostics for failures that happen before codex
#         echoes anything (auth/network).
#       Layer B (content-based): grep -Fvxf strips any surviving line that
#         is byte-identical to a prompt line — this is what survives codex
#         version drift in line counts (banner shape / prompt line count
#         changing between versions).
#     `|| true` on the ECHO_END lookup and the final pipe are MANDATORY:
#     set -euo pipefail means a grep returning 1 (no match / everything
#     filtered out) would otherwise kill the hook before it emits its
#     decision JSON.
#     LC_ALL=C on both greps (command-scoped, not exported — deliberately
#     narrower than the LC_ALL=C prefix-assignment pattern avoided
#     elsewhere in this file): CODEX_PROMPT_FILE embeds GLOBAL_MD/
#     PROJECT_MD truncated by BYTE count (`head -c`), which can slice a
#     multi-byte UTF-8 character in half. Under the active UTF-8 locale
#     that makes grep abort with "illegal byte sequence" — silently
#     emptying the diagnostic (the trailing `|| true` hides the failure).
#     Forcing the C locale makes grep treat input as raw bytes, matching
#     this pipeline's real behavior anyway: -F is already a fixed-string
#     byte match, and -x needs no locale-aware collation. ---
