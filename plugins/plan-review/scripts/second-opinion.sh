# second-opinion.sh — out-of-plugin driver for plan-review's engine
# infrastructure (agy + Gemini 3.1 Pro + REST fallback + session reuse),
# built on top of lib/consult.sh's run_consultation() state machine (PR1).
#
# Unlike plan-review.sh (a PreToolUse hook with plan-specific policy: plan
# extraction, ack-round counters, verdict routing, manifest parsing), this
# is a plain CLI a caller invokes directly to get a second opinion on any
# artifact. It does NO verdict parsing — stdout is the engine's raw review
# text, verbatim.
#
# Usage:
#   second-opinion.sh --system-prompt-file <path> [--system-prompt-file <path2> ...]
#                     [--prompt-file <path>] [--session <label>]
#
#   --system-prompt-file <path>  Required, repeatable. Concatenated in
#                                 command-line order to form the system
#                                 instructions sent to the engine. Missing
#                                 (none given), nonexistent, or empty file
#                                 → fail loud (nonzero exit, empty stdout).
#   --prompt-file <path>         Artifact body. If omitted, body is read from
#                                 stdin. If BOTH are given, --prompt-file wins
#                                 (stdin is the fallback for callers that
#                                 cannot write files, not a second source to
#                                 merge with an explicit file).
#   --session <label>            Opaque label for cross-invocation session
#                                 continuation (see "Session key derivation"
#                                 below). Charset: [A-Za-z0-9._-] only — no
#                                 "/" or "..". Omitted → single-round
#                                 stateless (a throwaway temp file backs
#                                 CONV_FILE for this one call, then is
#                                 removed).
#
# stdout: ONLY the review body (no JSON wrapper, no logs).
# stderr: diagnostics.
# exit 0: a result was obtained. exit != 0: all engines exhausted, OR a
#   fail-loud precondition (missing/bad args) was violated. This driver
#   deliberately does NOT reuse plan-review.sh's fail-OPEN pattern (a
#   synthesized "looks like a review" response is more dangerous than
#   getting nothing) — every failure here is fail-CLOSED.
#
# Explicitly NOT read: REVIEW_DISABLED, REVIEW_DRY_RUN — those two encode
# "turn off the ExitPlanMode gate" semantics; an explicit direct invocation
# of this driver must not be silently reshaped by them.
#
# Session key derivation (the design core — see plan issue #165 PR2 §B):
#   ${REVIEW_COUNTER_DIR:-/tmp/claude-reviews}/.so-<hash(label + system prompt bytes)[:16]>
# The hash folds in the ASSEMBLED system-prompt bytes, not just the label —
# so any rubric/prompt change automatically invalidates old sessions instead
# of silently resuming a stale one under a changed rubric. Reuses
# plan_hash() from lib/common.sh verbatim (sha256sum > shasum -a 256 >
# cksum fallback) — no new hash call is written here.
#
# CONV_FILE must never be passed empty: lib/engines/agy.sh's persistence
# step does `mv -f "${CONV_FILE}.tmp.$$" "$CONV_FILE"` — if CONV_FILE were
# ever an empty string, that `mv` target is empty, the command fails, is
# swallowed by `|| true`, and the `.tmp.$$` file leaks permanently into
# this process's cwd. This driver always assigns CONV_FILE a real path
# (either the derived session path, or a throwaway mktemp for the
# stateless case, registered into ENGINE_TMP_FILES for cleanup).
#
# REVIEW_COUNTER_DIR is shared with plan-review.sh (same DEGRADE_FILE, so
# Gemini capacity-exhaustion degraded state is shared between the hook and
# this driver) — this driver does not invent a separate directory.
#
# bash 3.2 compatible: no associative arrays, no ${var^^}, no &>>.
