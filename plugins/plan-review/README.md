# plan-review

Adversarial red-team review of implementation plans via cross-model consultation.

When Claude calls `ExitPlanMode`, this plugin intercepts the call and sends the plan to a review engine (Gemini, Claude, or Codex) for adversarial scrutiny. The reviewer can APPROVE, raise CONCERNS, or REJECT. On non-approval, feedback is returned to Claude for revision or rebuttal. After max rounds without consensus, the plan passes through for user arbitration.

### Engine interface

Each review engine implements three hooks that the orchestrator calls uniformly:

- **`engine_probe`** — called once, outside the retry loop: check the CLI is present, resolve
  model variables, and prepare any one-off temp resources. Returns non-zero if unusable.
- **`engine_invoke`** — called once per retry round: run the CLI, write raw output to
  `$ENGINE_OUT`, set `engine_exit`.
- **`engine_extract`** — read `$ENGINE_OUT` and set `REVIEW` to the review text. Verdict parsing
  happens later, in `lib/verdict.sh` — engines never see it.

Adding a new engine means adding one `lib/engines/<name>.sh` file that implements these three
functions, then adding one line to the orchestrator's engine whitelist `case` in `plan-review.sh`
— no other file needs to change.

`rest.sh` is the exception: it is a fallback channel, not a fourth first-class engine. It only
activates after the CLI retry budget is exhausted, and it always runs alongside whichever engine
was already sourced in the same process — so its functions use a `rest_` prefix instead of
implementing the three-hook interface, to avoid colliding with the active engine's own function
names.

## Environment Variables

### `plan-review.sh` (ExitPlanMode adversarial review)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `REVIEW_ENGINE` | `gemini` | Review engine: `gemini` (default, routed through the local `agy` CLI), `claude` (`claude -p` subprocess), or `codex` (`codex exec` subprocess) |
| `AGY_MODEL` | `Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)` | Model id passed to the `agy` CLI when `REVIEW_ENGINE=gemini` |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | `opus` | Claude model when `REVIEW_ENGINE=claude` |
| `CODEX_BIN` | _(empty)_ | Path to the `codex` binary. Default: `codex` as resolved on `PATH`. Set this when codex is not on `PATH` |
| `CODEX_MODEL` | _(empty)_ | Model id passed to `codex exec` when `REVIEW_ENGINE=codex`. Empty means inherit whatever `~/.codex/config.toml` specifies |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | Model id used only by the REST fallback payload (not the `agy` CLI path) |
| `REVIEW_DISABLED` | `0` | Set `1` to bypass entirely |
| `REVIEW_DRY_RUN` | `0` | Set `1` to skip engine call (synthetic APPROVE) |
| `REVIEW_MAX_ROUNDS` | `3` | Max non-Critical consultation rounds (CONCERNS accumulation) before escalation |
| `REVIEW_MAX_TOTAL_ROUNDS` | `20` | Absolute global ceiling (including REJECT rounds); hard-blocks once reached |
| `REVIEW_REPO_ACCESS` | `0` | codex engine only. Set `1` to run the reviewer with `-C <project cwd>` (still `-s read-only`) instead of an empty temp dir, letting it ground findings — and verify the plan author's factual rebuttals — against real code. Trade-offs: repo content becomes readable by the engine's provider, and rounds get slower |
| `REVIEW_ENGINE_TIMEOUT` | `595` | Engine call timeout in seconds (requires `timeout`/`gtimeout` on `PATH`) |
| `REVIEW_API_URL` | _(empty)_ | REST API fallback base URL (OpenAI-compatible), used when the CLI path fails |
| `REVIEW_API_KEY` | _(empty)_ | REST API fallback bearer token |
| `REVIEW_REST_TIMEOUT` | `115` | REST fallback curl timeout in seconds (clamped to `remaining-3` by the budget logic) |
| `REVIEW_REST_STALL_TIMEOUT` | `90` | REST SSE stream stall watchdog (`curl --speed-time`), tuned to tolerate legitimate reasoning-model TTFT |
| `REVIEW_HOOK_BUDGET` | `595` | Total hook time budget in seconds (600s hook timeout minus 5s margin); governs the retry loop and REST timeout clamping |
| `REVIEW_CAPACITY_DELAY` | `25` | Wait time after detecting `MODEL_CAPACITY_EXHAUSTED` (skipped — breaks immediately to REST — when REST is configured) |
| `REVIEW_ENGINE_DEGRADE_TTL` | `600` | TTL in seconds for the Gemini degrade state; subsequent hooks within the TTL skip the CLI and go straight to REST. Shortened from 3600 in v1.2.0 — agy 429 probing is cheap (~26s median) and multi-round session reuse lowers 429 frequency, so a shorter cooldown recovers agy faster without thrashing |

Legacy variables (`GEMINI_REVIEW_OFF`, `GEMINI_DRY_RUN`, `GEMINI_MAX_REVIEWS`) are supported via fallback mapping.

### `second-opinion.sh` (generic second-opinion driver)

The driver reuses the same engine variables above (`REVIEW_ENGINE`, `AGY_MODEL`, `CLAUDE_MODEL`,
`CODEX_BIN`, `CODEX_MODEL`, `GEMINI_MODEL`, `REVIEW_API_URL`, `REVIEW_API_KEY`,
`REVIEW_REST_TIMEOUT`, `REVIEW_REST_STALL_TIMEOUT`, `REVIEW_HOOK_BUDGET`,
`REVIEW_CAPACITY_DELAY`, `REVIEW_ENGINE_DEGRADE_TTL`) and shares `REVIEW_COUNTER_DIR` (and
therefore `DEGRADE_FILE`) with `plan-review.sh` — a Gemini capacity degrade tripped by one is
honored by the other. It does **not** provide its own `--timeout` flag; time budget is inherited
purely from env (`REVIEW_ENGINE_TIMEOUT` / `REVIEW_HOOK_BUDGET`). It also does **not** read
`REVIEW_DISABLED` or `REVIEW_DRY_RUN` — see [Second Opinion Entry Point](#second-opinion-entry-point-second-opinionsh)
for why. `REVIEW_LOG_DIR` (default `~/.claude/logs`) controls where its own `second-opinion.log`
is written, separate from `plan-review.log`.

### `dispatch-check.sh` (Layer 2 — Agent/Task dispatch enforcement)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DISPATCH_CHECK_DISABLED` | `0` | Set `1` to disable the Layer 2 Manifest v2 signature check (kill switch) |

### Dispatch Manifest v2

A plan with dispatch keywords must include a Dispatch Manifest with at least one
`agent` row. A plan without dispatch keywords, including Tier0 work, remains
Manifest-free. `plan-review.sh` stores only the approved v2 signature set. The
fixed columns are `step | location | subagent_type | model_source | model |
depends_on | parallel_with`.

- `main` rows use `-` for `subagent_type`, `model_source`, and `model`.
- `agent` + `preset` rows require `subagent_type` and require the tool call to
  omit `model`.
- `agent` + `runtime` rows require both `subagent_type` and `model`; the hook
  matches both values exactly.

The hook permits repeated matching calls. It does not implement a step cursor,
call count, execution order, or global model ownership policy. State with no
schema marker is treated as temporary Manifest v1 compatibility state: the hook
emits a migration prompt and skips enforcement. Corrupt, stale, or invalid state
fails open.

## Consultation Flow

```
ExitPlanMode → hook intercepts → engine reviews
  ├─ APPROVE → ack-deny: present review + re-call ExitPlanMode → allow (user's native go/no-go)
  ├─ CONCERNS/REJECT → deny + feedback → Claude revises → re-submit
  └─ max rounds reached → allow through (user decides)
```

An engine APPROVE is **not** authorization to start work — it only clears the plan
for the user's native ExitPlanMode decision. The ack-deny message instructs Claude to
present the review and re-call ExitPlanMode (unchanged); only the user's native approval
on that second call permits execution.

## Review Criteria

Eight criteria — authoritative text is split across two files (see [Architecture](#architecture)):

- `scripts/assets/review-common.md` — the generic layer: version-identifier ground truth, Review
  Discipline, Finding Quality Gate, Severity Definitions, Verdict Rules, Output Format. Shared by
  every caller of the engine infrastructure, including `second-opinion.sh`; it never assumes the
  reviewed artifact is a plan.
- `scripts/assets/review-plan.md` — the plan-specific layer: framing, Scope Boundary, the 8
  criteria below, and the output length cap. Only `plan-review.sh` uses this file, concatenating
  it ahead of `review-common.md` when assembling the hook's system prompt.

| # | Criterion | Focus |
|---|-----------|-------|
| 1 | **Correctness** | Does the plan actually solve the stated problem? |
| 2 | **Completeness** | Missing steps, edge cases, error handling? |
| 3 | **Simplicity** | Is there a simpler approach? Unnecessary complexity? |
| 4 | **Safety** | Security risks, data loss, backwards-compatibility breaks? |
| 5 | **Testability** | Test strategy presence; test pyramid completeness; e2e selector cascade (evidence-gated); deletion completeness for exported symbols |
| 6 | **Architecture fit** | Consistent with project patterns? |
| 7 | **Dispatch Economy** | Main decision work, preset registered agents, runtime built-ins, and mechanical work delegation rules |
| 8 | **Reuse over reinvention** | Using existing dependencies before building custom? |

Criterion #5 (Testability) is evidence-gated: e2e selector audits only trigger if the plan or project context reveals e2e coverage (Playwright, Cypress, `*.spec.ts`, `e2e/` directory).

## Engine Isolation (Claude)

When `REVIEW_ENGINE=claude`, the script spawns `claude -p` with triple isolation:

1. **`PLAN_REVIEW_RUNNING=1`** — recursive guard; subprocess bails immediately if set
2. **`--setting-sources local`** — loads only `settings.local.json`, no project/user hooks
3. **`--tools ""`** — no tool calls = no PreToolUse events = no hook re-entry

`unset CLAUDECODE` and `unset CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` prevent the subprocess from inheriting parent's internal state. This is implementation-dependent but necessary: user authenticates via OAuth (`claude login`), no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` available, making `claude -p` the only viable invocation path.

## Engine Isolation (Codex)

When `REVIEW_ENGINE=codex`, the script spawns `codex exec` with a parallel set of isolation flags:

1. **`-s read-only`** — sandbox policy; the reviewer process cannot write to disk
2. **`-C <fresh empty temp dir>`** — the working root is a throwaway empty directory, not the user's project. This relocates the working root; on its own it does not stop a tool from reaching paths outside that directory (see the tool-surface caveat below). With `REVIEW_REPO_ACCESS=1` the working root becomes the project cwd instead (sandbox stays read-only) — an explicit opt-in trading isolation for grounded review
3. **`--ephemeral`** — no session files persisted to disk
4. **`--skip-git-repo-check`** — required because the isolated temp dir is not a git repo

The prompt is fed via stdin (no `ARG_MAX` limit, unlike the agy path which needs a 256KB guard), and the final message is captured via `-o <file>`.

**Tool-surface caveat**: the four flags above constrain the file scope the reviewer sees; they do not disable codex's agent tool surface. Whether MCP servers or web search remain available to the reviewer follows the user's own `~/.codex/config.toml`. This differs from the `claude` engine, where `--tools ""` removes the tool surface outright. The plugin leaves codex's tool configuration to the user rather than overriding it — silently rewriting a user's engine config is the worse trade. Users who require a text-only reviewer should disable those tools in their codex configuration.

**stderr handling**: `codex exec` echoes the entire prompt to stderr. Because of this, codex's stderr is deliberately **not** appended to the plan-review log (unlike the other engines) — doing so would duplicate the full prompt into the log file. On a failed call, only a filtered diagnostic is written to the log: the banner plus trailing `warning:`/`ERROR:` lines, with any line matching the prompt stripped out, truncated to 500 chars.

## Session Reuse (agy, v1.2.0)

When `REVIEW_ENGINE=gemini` (agy CLI), a multi-round consultation reuses one agy server-side conversation instead of resending the full static prompt every round:

- **First round** builds a fresh conversation and captures the `conversation_id` agy assigns (via `--output-format json`).
- **Subsequent rounds** resume it with `--conversation <id>`, sending only the volatile tail (current plan + round framing). The static prefix (system instructions + project/global context) already lives in agy's session history, so the provider serves it from prompt cache.

This lowers 429 frequency and quota consumption on multi-round negotiations. The conversation reference is session-scoped and torn down when the review cycle ends (approve / escalate / no-plan / global valve), on any non-zero agy exit (capacity, timeout, resume-rejected, network), when a response cannot be parsed, or when the plan changes after an approval. Extraction/reuse failures fall through to a plain agy call or REST — never a new blocking path.

**agy invocation contract**: since v1.2.0 the agy CLI is always called with `--output-format json`, and the review body is text-sliced out of the (not-well-formed) JSON `response` field. This depends on agy's envelope carrying `conversation_id` and `response` keys. If a future agy build changes that envelope shape, extraction fails closed (empty review → retry / REST fallback), so a shape change degrades gracefully rather than mis-parsing — but it does mean the agy path is coupled to this envelope. The `claude` engine path and the REST fallback are unchanged. With no env config, the review decision logic behaves as before; the observable deltas are the JSON invocation, multi-round session reuse, and the shorter degrade cooldown (600s).

## Round Memory (v1.5.0)

`--conversation` session reuse (above) is an agy-only, token-cost optimization — it is not the source of truth for cross-round memory. Every other engine has none of its own: `claude` runs with `--no-session-persistence`, `codex` runs `--ephemeral`, and the REST fallback has no session concept at all. Round memory therefore lives in the orchestrator itself, not in any one engine.

Each `CONCERNS`/`REJECT` round's verdict and review body is appended to a per-session thread file (byte-budgeted via `clamp_head_bytes`). On the next round, the orchestrator injects that accumulated thread as a `## Prior Review Thread` section (byte-budgeted via `clamp_tail_bytes`, keeping the most recent rounds) whenever no engine already has live native memory of its own for this round — covering `claude`, `codex`, REST, and agy itself once its `--conversation` handle is lost (extraction failure, CLI error, or first round). The injection is evaluated at two points: prompt composition, and again immediately before the REST fallback fires — a resume-round agy CLI failure clears the conversation handle *after* composition already judged native memory available, so the second check is what keeps REST from receiving a prompt with no history at all.

The `## Consultation Context` block (present whenever a plan is past its first round) carries delta review rules alongside the round-number framing: re-verify prior Critical findings against the current plan, treat a new non-Critical finding on unchanged text as a forfeited relitigation, focus new findings on changed text, and hold rebuttals to a symmetric evidence burden (an unverifiable factual claim does not clear a finding). These rules apply identically to every engine, including agy's own session-resume rounds, which carry a duplicate of this text since they bypass the shared prompt file entirely.

The thread's lifetime mirrors the review cycle: cleared whenever a cycle ends — approval, either safety valve, no-plan fail-closed, or an orphan exit (engine not found / not attempted — dropped to avoid leaking one plan's findings into an unrelated later plan under the same session id). The one exception is a plan revised after approval (plan hash no longer matches the approved marker): that is not a cycle end — the counter keeps counting — so the thread survives with an appended revision marker instead of being cleared, since prior findings on this same plan are exactly the highest-value context to carry into the re-review. Only the `--conversation` handle is dropped there, since it embeds the full old plan text server-side.

No new environment variables — the byte budgets are fixed defaults in `lib/common.sh` (`HISTORY_ROUND_BYTES=9000` per recorded round, `HISTORY_INJECT_BYTES=48000` on injection), sized so a full-length CJK review (`review-plan.md` caps output at 3000 characters, ~9KB in Chinese) survives a single round uncut and roughly 5 rounds of thread history survive injection. Once a plan's accumulated thread exceeds the injection budget, `clamp_tail_bytes` keeps the most recent rounds and silently drops the oldest ones first. These match the raised `CLAUDE.md` ingestion limits below (`GLOBAL_MD_BYTES=8000`, `PROJECT_MD_BYTES=24000`).

## Second Opinion Entry Point (second-opinion.sh)

`second-opinion.sh` is a generic, out-of-hook driver built on the same engine infrastructure
(agy + Gemini 3.1 Pro + REST fallback + session reuse) that `plan-review.sh` uses. Unlike the
hook, it is a plain CLI: any caller invokes it directly to get a second opinion on any artifact —
not just an implementation plan — and gets back raw review text, not a verdict decision.

### Interface

```
second-opinion.sh --system-prompt-file <path> [--system-prompt-file <path2> ...]
                  [--prompt-file <path>] [--session <label>]
```

- `--system-prompt-file` — **required, repeatable**. Concatenated in command-line order to form
  the system instructions sent to the engine. Missing entirely, pointing at a nonexistent path, or
  an empty file is **fail loud**: nonzero exit, empty stdout. There is no fallback rubric — unlike
  the hook, this driver never silently substitutes the plan-review criteria for a caller that
  forgot to pass one.
- Artifact body — `--prompt-file <path>` or stdin. **stdin is the only path available to callers
  that are forbidden from writing files** (e.g. redteam-style callers operating under a
  read-only mandate). If both are given, `--prompt-file` wins; stdin is a fallback for
  file-write-averse callers, not a second source merged with an explicit file.
- stdout carries **only** the review body — no JSON wrapper, no log lines. stderr carries all
  diagnostics. Exit 0 means a result was obtained; nonzero means every engine was exhausted, or a
  fail-loud precondition was violated.

**Fail loud, not fail open.** `plan-review.sh` fails open (allows the tool call through) on every
engine failure, because the cost of a false block is high and the hook has a native human
approval step downstream regardless. This driver has no such downstream backstop — a caller
treats whatever comes out of stdout as the review. A synthesized "looks like a review" response
here would be actively misleading, so every failure path is fail-closed: nonzero exit, empty
stdout, diagnostic on stderr.

**Does not read `REVIEW_DISABLED` / `REVIEW_DRY_RUN`.** Those two variables encode "turn off the
ExitPlanMode gate" semantics for the hook. An explicit, direct invocation of this driver is not
that gate — it must not be silently reshaped by env state that was set for a different call site.

**Shares `DEGRADE_FILE`** with `plan-review.sh` (same `REVIEW_COUNTER_DIR`) so a Gemini
capacity-exhaustion degrade tripped by one caller is honored by the other. **Does no verdict
parsing** — the driver is a transport layer only; `<verdict>` tags, if present in the engine's
response, are returned as-is inside the raw text.

### Session continuation (`--session <label>`)

`--session <label>` takes an opaque label, not a file path. The actual session-file path is
derived by the driver:

```
${REVIEW_COUNTER_DIR:-/tmp/claude-reviews}/.so-<hash(label + assembled system-prompt bytes)[:16]>
```

The hash folds in the **assembled system-prompt bytes**, not just the label, via `plan_hash()`
(`lib/common.sh`, reused verbatim — sha256sum → shasum -a 256 → cksum fallback, so this stays
portable across Linux and macOS). This is deliberate: it means a rubric edit invalidates the old
session automatically. A caller does not need to remember "I changed the prompt, so I must also
throw away the old `--session` value" — that is a rule a path-based scheme would require the
caller to enforce themselves, and forgetting it means resuming a stale session under a changed
rubric, silently mixing old and new review criteria.

Real evidence from testing: with the same `--session` label, changing one byte of the system
prompt changed the derived key from `9f2d2375...` to `bf96267a...`, and the engine returned to a
genuinely fresh first round (no reference to "the previous round") instead of resuming the old
one.

Omitting `--session` gives a single-round, stateless call backed by a throwaway temp file — no
session persists past that one invocation.

Multi-round memory under `--session` is **not unconditional**. It lives entirely in agy's
server-side `--conversation` session, which only accumulates while the agy CLI path keeps
succeeding. If the agy CLI fails on a given round and the REST fallback produces the review
instead, that round's output never reaches agy's session history — the driver detects this and
deletes the session file (`CONV_FILE`) rather than leave a conversation handle with a silent gap
in it. The **next** round under the same `--session` label therefore starts over as a fresh first
round, with no memory of anything before the REST fallback fired. Callers relying on continuity
across rounds should treat "agy CLI succeeded every round so far" as the precondition for that
continuity, not the `--session` flag alone.

### Path discovery

The officially recommended path is:

```
~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-plugins/plugins/plan-review/scripts/second-opinion.sh
```

This is the version-less, CC-maintained git checkout — the one under `marketplaces/`, not
`cache/`. **This has a real cost, and it is intentional to state it plainly rather than let
callers discover it by surprise**: `marketplaces/` tracks the marketplace `HEAD`, but the hook
actually loads assets from `plugins/cache/<version>/`. The two drift apart across a push — a
caller invoking the `marketplaces/` path picks up a change immediately on push; the hook only
picks it up after the next plugin reinstall. The same asset can therefore be two different
versions depending on which of the two consumers is looking at it.

**Do not glob `find ~/.claude/plugins -path '.../second-opinion.sh'` and take the first hit.**
Tested against the structurally identical `pr-review` plugin, that glob returned three hits
(`marketplaces/` + two different `cache/<version>/` directories); `head -1` picking the "right"
one is an accident of filesystem traversal order, not a guarantee. `plan-review`'s own `cache/`
directory currently has four different versions sitting side by side.

### Time budget

The driver does **not** provide its own `--timeout` flag — time budget is purely inherited from
env (`REVIEW_ENGINE_TIMEOUT` / `REVIEW_HOOK_BUDGET`). To override, set those env vars inline on
the invocation. Worst-case measured latency was ~415s (agy self-terminates at its own
`--print-timeout` 5-minute mark, the retry guard breaks out because the remaining time budget is
insufficient for another attempt, and REST fallback then gets its own 115s). Callers wrapping the
driver in a `timeout` command should budget **at least 480s**.

### Known limitation: no usage/log traceability

The driver does not set `SESSION_ID`, so its calls produce **no** `agy-conversation` /
`agy-usage` log lines — the driver's diagnostics go to stderr only (`second-opinion.log`), by
design, but the practical effect is that a driver invocation **cannot be traced from
`plan-review.log`**. If you need to quantify the driver's own token consumption, that requires
adding a separate extraction mechanism — not currently in scope.

### Example

```bash
SO=~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-plugins/plugins/plan-review/scripts/second-opinion.sh
"$SO" --system-prompt-file <your-own-rubric>.md \
      --system-prompt-file <plugin>/scripts/assets/review-common.md \
      --session my-review-t7 <<'EOF'
<artifact under review>
EOF
```

Order matters: your own rubric goes first, `review-common.md` goes last. The plugin's own
`review-plan.md` follows the same rule (see [Review Criteria](#review-criteria) above) because it
opens with framing language ("You are a senior software architect performing...") that must lead
the assembled prompt; `review-common.md` is the shared review discipline and output-format layer,
so it belongs at the end regardless of what precedes it.

## Fault Tolerance

- **jq missing** → allow (can't parse input)
- **Engine CLI missing** → allow + stderr warning
- **Engine call fails** → allow + stderr warning
- **Empty response** → allow
- **Malformed verdict** → fail-closed as CONCERNS
- **Log directory unwritable** → logs to `/dev/null`, core logic unaffected

- **Global CLAUDE.md** — first 8KB of `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- **Project CLAUDE.md** — first 24KB of `$CWD/CLAUDE.md`
- **Recent conversation** — last 3 user messages from the session transcript
- **Plan content** — the full implementation plan under review
- **Prior review thread** (v1.5.0, multi-round only) — up to the most recent 24KB of accumulated verdicts and review findings from earlier rounds on the same plan (see [Round Memory](#round-memory-v150)), sent to whichever provider handles the CURRENT round — not necessarily the same provider that produced the earlier findings if `REVIEW_ENGINE` changed mid-session
- **Repository contents** — only with `REVIEW_REPO_ACCESS=1` (codex): the reviewer runs read-only inside the project working directory and may read any file in it

This context is necessary for meaningful adversarial review. If your CLAUDE.md or conversations contain sensitive information (internal hostnames, credentials, business logic), be aware that this data will be sent to the external API — and, on multi-round reviews, may be echoed back into the thread and re-sent on subsequent rounds.
