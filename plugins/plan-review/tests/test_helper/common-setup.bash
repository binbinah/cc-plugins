# --- Mock Engine Generators ---

# create_mock_engine <name> <output>
#   Creates an executable mock at MOCK_BIN/<name> that prints <output> to stdout.
#
#   JSON-aware (agy --output-format json): the production script calls agy with
#   `--output-format json` and unwraps the `response` field via awk. So this mock
#   auto-detects that flag and, when present, wraps <output> into agy's JSON
#   envelope (deliberately with raw newlines in the response value — mirroring
#   agy's actual NOT-well-formed JSON). Without the flag it prints <output> as
#   plain text (claude engine path / legacy). This one change keeps all existing
#   `create_mock_engine "agy" "<text>"` call sites working unchanged.
#
#   Also captures the invocation args to ${MOCK_BIN}/../.agy-args-<name> so tests
#   can assert whether `--conversation <id>` was passed (session-reuse behavior).
#   Fixed test conversation_id: aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee
#
#   Also captures whatever this invocation received on STDIN to
#   ${MOCK_BIN}/../.mock-stdin-<name> (read back via `mock_stdin <name>`).
#   Only the claude engine path actually pipes a real prompt over stdin
#   (`< "$PROMPT_FILE"`); agy passes its prompt as a `-p` CLI arg instead
#   (already assertable via agy_args), so for agy this capture is simply
#   empty — harmless, and uniform is simpler than special-casing per engine.
#   Safe against blocking: by the time any engine subprocess spawns, the
#   hook's own top-of-script `INPUT=$(cat)` has already drained the test
#   harness's heredoc stdin to EOF, so an unredirected `cat` here returns
#   immediately instead of hanging on a terminal.
