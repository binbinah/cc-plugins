#!/usr/bin/env bats
# Composition test: does the set of outroutes claimed for dispatch actually
# clear EVERY PreToolUse(Agent|Task) guard this plugin registers, not just
# the one guard whose own test file happens to cover it?
#
# Motivating failure (claude-config 仓 issue 173): pre-dispatch-channel-guard.sh's
# header once asserted, in prose only, that dropping `name` to escape THIS
# gate would not walk straight into dispatch-sync-guard.sh's BLOCK (missing
# run_in_background:false). That assertion was false in the fork world and
# stayed false for months, because dispatch-channel-guard.bats only ever
# invoked pre-dispatch-channel-guard.sh in isolation — no test ever fed the
# same payload to both gates in sequence, so nothing could catch the prose
# going stale. This file turns that prose claim into code: build the payload
# for each claimed outroute once, run it through every gate in GATE_SCRIPTS,
# and assert every one of them returns exit 0.
#
# Gate discovery (see discover_agent_gates/discover_task_gates in
# test_helper/common-setup.bash) reads hooks.json's PreToolUse section at
# test time instead of hardcoding script names — any additional PreToolUse
# guard added to this plugin later is automatically included in every test below
# without touching this file. hooks.json registers the same four guards
# under BOTH the "Agent" and "Task" matchers (Lead/PM can dispatch via
# either tool), so this file checks both matchers independently (composition
# #7/#8/#9 below) — the Agent-only checks alone would stay green even if a
# guard were stripped from only the "Task" side, reproducing the exact
# same-shape blind spot issue 173 already burned this plugin once for.
#
# Negative-control discipline (Design requirement C): asserting "the two
# claimed outroutes pass everywhere" is not sufficient on its own — if some
# future change degraded every gate into an unconditional `exit 0`, that
# assertion alone would keep passing. So this file also asserts the inverse:
# payloads that are NOT any claimed outroute must be rejected by at least
# one gate in the set. Those negative-control tests are the load-bearing
# check that the composition assertions above mean anything; mutation test
# #4 in the accompanying report exists specifically to verify this file
# itself would catch a gate collapsing to `exit 0`.
#
# Non-empty-prompt discipline (Design requirement F): mk_composed_payload
# never set tool_input.prompt until this patch, and
# dispatch-capability-guard.sh's very first branch after field extraction is
# `[ -z "$PROMPT" ] && exit 0` — so every "clears every gate" assertion here
# was, for that one guard, true for a reason unrelated to its judgment logic
# (a real Agent/Task dispatch always carries a prompt, so the old payload
# shape was not even a realistic fixture). Composition #1/#2 now carry a
# neutral, judgment-safe prompt (see setup's NEUTRAL_PROMPT comment) so that
# guard's participation in the composition assertion is no longer vacuous;
# composition #11 supplies the matching positive control (a payload built
# from the same mk_composed_payload shape that must BLOCK) so the vacuity
# concern is closed on both sides, not just asserted away by adding a
# prompt.
