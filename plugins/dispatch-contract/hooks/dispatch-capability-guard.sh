#!/usr/bin/env bash
# PreToolUse hook (matcher: Agent, Task): block ad-hoc dispatch calls whose
# subagent_type/model cannot deliver what the prompt itself asks for.
#
# Two capability-need signals (EXEC, WRITE) and two read-only-declaration
# signals (RO, NEG) are extracted from the prompt text. They combine into one
# derived predicate:
#
#   NEEDS_CAP = (EXEC || WRITE) && !RO && !NEG
#
# ...meaning "this task asks for something beyond read-only, and nothing in
# the same prompt declares the task read-only after all". Three independent
# judgments fire off that signal set:
#
#   A (originally migrated verbatim from pre-dispatch-readonly-guard.sh;
#      condition WIDENED from !EXEC to !EXEC && !WRITE_A — see "A's exemption"
#      below for why the verbatim condition stopped holding; WRITE_A is a
#      NEG-scrubbed variant of WRITE, not the raw WRITE signal — see
#      WRITE_HIT_A's own comment near its computation for why the raw
#      signal is not safe to reuse here):
#        !EXEC && !WRITE_A && (RO || NEG) && TYPE in {general-purpose, claude}
#        -> read-only declaration sent to a full-privilege agent; Explore's
#           Edit/Write/NotebookEdit are physically disabled, so re-dispatch
#           there cannot exceed scope even if the declaration is wrong.
#
#      A's exemption (why !EXEC alone is no longer correct): the original
#      pre-dispatch-readonly-guard.sh had no WRITE signal, so !EXEC meant
#      "this task needs nothing beyond read-only" in that world. Once WRITE
#      was introduced, a prompt like "只读查看现有实现，然后修复 main.py" hits
#      !EXEC (true, no exec-intent phrase) AND RO (true, "只读查看") AND WRITE
#      (true, "修复 main.py") at the same time. Under the old !EXEC-only
#      condition, A fired and told the caller to re-dispatch to Explore — but
#      Explore's Edit/Write is physically disabled, so the re-dispatch cannot
#      do what the prompt asks. That is a dead end the gate manufactured,
#      not a legitimate rejection. Adding
#      !WRITE closes it: a prompt carrying write intent is no longer routed
#      toward an agent that cannot write, regardless of what RO/NEG also say
#      in the same prompt.
#
#   B (new): NEEDS_CAP && TYPE in {explore, plan}
#        -> this task needs write/exec capability, but Explore/Plan have
#           Edit/Write/NotebookEdit physically disabled and Bash limited to a
#           read-only whitelist. The dispatch would dead-end after burning a
#           full round trip. Re-dispatch to general-purpose/dev.
#
#      B's accepted miss (NOT the same gap as A's old dead end above): mixed
#      RO+WRITE prompts dispatched directly to Explore (e.g. "调研根因并修复"
#      sent straight to subagent_type=explore) still pass, because NEEDS_CAP
#      folds to 0 whenever RO_HIT is 1 (see NEEDS_CAP's own comment below).
#      This is a real under-block and it is deliberately kept — tightening
#      NEEDS_CAP to ignore RO for mixed prompts would flood genuine read-only
#      research dispatches with false positives. The reason this is safe to
#      leave as B's problem rather than promoted to a fix: it is a same-shape
#      miss that existed before this patch too (today's behavior for such
#      prompts is already "pass"), so leaving it is a no-op, not a regression.
#      It must not be confused with A's now-fixed dead end: A's problem was
#      that the gate ACTIVELY REJECTED and then pointed the caller at an
#      agent that physically cannot comply — a self-inflicted trap with no
#      good exit. B's miss is merely PASSIVE under-coverage — the dispatch
#      goes through unexamined, which is exactly today's baseline, not a
#      regression this patch introduces or a trap this patch built.
#
#   C (new): NEEDS_CAP && is_runtime_model_agent(TYPE) && model contains "haiku"
#        -> this task needs write/exec capability, which in practice means
#           interpreting run/test/build output well enough to decide what to
#           do next — a judgment-forming action the haiku tier is excluded
#           from by the daily model-tiering rubric (取数活 vs 落地活). Model
#           substring match, not exact match: real values look like
#           "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001", never the bare word. Registered
#           agents and model-optional built-ins are both outside C's
#           judgment range — only runtime-owned built-ins are examined here.
#
# B and C are independent: a dispatch can hit both at once (Explore + haiku
# asked to fix code), and both rejection messages are printed before the
# single trailing `exit 2` — a caller fixing only one would still get bounced
# by the other on re-dispatch otherwise.
#
# subagent_type default: an ABSENT field means "general-purpose" (the
# platform's own fallback), not "treat as missing" — same rule
# pre-dispatch-readonly-guard.sh already applies, kept for A's parity.
#
# Escape hatch: ALLOW_DISPATCH_CAPABILITY_MISMATCH=1 in the `env` block of
# ~/.claude/settings.json (a plain Bash `export` does not reach this hook's
# process — it is spawned by the CC main process, not by the calling shell).
# One hook, one switch: the old pre-dispatch-readonly-guard.sh switch name
# ALLOW_READONLY_DISPATCH_WRITE described judgment A only; this hook's scope
# widened to bidirectional capability matching (A + B + C), so it gets a name
# that describes the widened scope instead of carrying the old, now-partial
# name forward.
#
# [GATE-DEGRADE] vs [GATE-BYPASS]: these two stderr tags are NOT the same
# condition and must not collapse into one. [GATE-BYPASS] means a human
# deliberately opened the escape hatch — not a malfunction, and checked BEFORE
# any degrade path so an open hatch is never misreported as broken judgment
# data. [GATE-DEGRADE] means the judgment data itself could not be read
# (empty stdin, missing jq, malformed JSON, unexpected field shape) — the gate
# could not form an opinion at all. Merging the two labels would make a grep
# for real breakage indistinguishable from every session that simply has the
# hatch on, which is exactly how issue #164's silent gate death went
# unnoticed for months. This preamble is inlined rather than sourced from
# ~/.claude/hooks/lib/gate.sh because that path is a different repo — a
# cross-repo `source` would make this hook's behavior depend on a file this
# plugin does not ship and cannot pin.
#
# No tool_name filter is implemented here on purpose: this script is wired
# into hooks.json under two separate matcher entries, "Agent" and "Task".
# The framework itself gates delivery to those matchers, so a tool_name
# branch inside the script would be dead code with no reachable false path —
# writing it would misleadingly imply the check does something.
